# Travel with us...
This repo contains a Travel Website where we give the best places to visit for each place.  This  was created using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. It is lightweight and fully responsive. 
The idea behind this Website was because I needed a project for my Ai1 class, so I tought in something that I would use, and there it is ***Travel with us...***

## Task
### Objectives
* With this project we want to make a ***static website*** totally functional with a theme at our choice.
* The project needs to be implemented using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
  * The layout of the page must focus on the use of **percentages**, and use the HTML5 semantic tags (nav, main, etc). The page must have some transitions/animations in links, buttons, etc. That allows to give a look and feel more appealing and easy to use.
  * It must have some JavaScript animations:  
	  1. On the home page of the website must be a *slider* of atleast three images. The image should change in accordance with a time interval.
	  2. The navigation menu should have submenus and use the capabilities of CSS and JavaScript to become more *user friendly*. Should have hover animations(changing text and background color).
	  3. It must have in all the webpage a clock using the computer clock.
### Requirements
* Must use all the taught subjects;
* The layout must use CSS containers;

  4. Give a good amount of options for the client
